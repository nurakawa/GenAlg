# GeneticTSP
Project for the course Evolutionary Algorithms [H02D1a] at KU Leuven. It is an implementation of an evolutionary algorithms for the *Traveling Salesman Problem* in Python.

 A utility module `run.py` has been added to make it easy to run from the command line.

# Execution
To run this application, you can either directly run the `optimize()` function in the templates, or by executing the following command (or setting defaults and running `run.py`):

```
python run.py [tourname] 
```
Tourname can be any of: *tour29, tour194, tour929*

Defaults for `tourname` and `project` can be set in `run.py`.

# The Algorithm
Here will be an explanation of a genetic algorithm and this specific solution the the TSP. More to come soon!
